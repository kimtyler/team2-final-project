#- name: Authentication changes in version 10.5.5 message
##  debug:
##    msg: >
##      Authentication has changed in version 10.5.5. Both the root user and
##      the user that owns the data directory (mysql by default) now utilize
##      the unix_socket plugin for passwordless access, and are created with
##      an invalid password. Therefore setting a password isn't required for
##      those user accounts accessing via the unix socket. Please see
##      https://mariadb.org/authentication-in-mariadb-10-4/ .
##      Skipping authentication setup tasks!
